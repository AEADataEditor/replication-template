# [MC number] [Manuscript Title] Validation and Replication results

> INSTRUCTIONS: Once you've read these instructions, DELETE THESE AND SIMILAR LINES. Also delete lines that include "{{  SOME-TEXT }}".

> INSTRUCTIONS: In the above title, replace [Manuscript Title] with the actual title of the paper, and [MC number] with the Manuscript Central number (e.g., AEJPol-2017-0097)

> INSTRUCTIONS: Go through the steps to download and attempt a replication. Document your steps here, the errors generated, and the steps you took to alleviate those errors. This includes apparently minor steps, such as adjusting directories, or installing packages, any deviations from the README. If the README did not specify a certain step or action, describe why you chose that action, and whether it should be detailed in the README. All figures and tables should be evident once you are done, i.e., saved to disk. If this is not done in code, please add code to do so.

> INSTRUCTIONS: To compare images and tables, annotated screenshots from the manuscript can be helpful for comparison, highlighting where differences were found.

## SUMMARY

> INSTRUCTION: The Data Editor will fill this part out. It will be based on any [REQUIRED] and [SUGGESTED] action items that the report makes a note of.

> INSTRUCTION: The next line CLOSES the summary.

In assessing compliance with our [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code), we have identified the following issues, which we ask you to address:


### Action Items (manuscript)

> INSTRUCTION: Add all manuscript related items here.

> INSTRUCTION: If any changes are needed, leave the following text in; otherwise, remove it:

> [REQUIRED] If making changes to the manuscript, please describe in a response letter to the Editor and Data Editor any deviations from the conditionally accepted version (as approved by the Editor) and their impact, especially of key estimates or outcomes. Email that response letter to the Data Editor at dataeditor@aeapubs.org, referencing the manuscript number.


### Action Items (openICPSR)

> INSTRUCTION: leave the next few lines in, do not delete them.

-----action items go here------

> If your openICPSR deposit appears to be "locked", please follow [these instructions](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/FAQ.html#you-can-recall-the-submission).

> The openICPSR submission process has changed. If you have not already done so, please "Change Status -> Submit to AEA" from your deposit Workspace.

> [NOTE] Since July 1, 2021, we will publish replication packages as soon as all requested changes to the deposit have been made. Please process any requested changes as soon as possible.

## Data description

### Data Sources

> INSTRUCTIONS: Identify all INPUT data sources. Create a list (and commit the list together with this report) (not needed if filling out the "Data Citation and Information report"). For each data source, list in THIS document presence or absence of source, codebook/information on the data, and summary statistics. Summary statistics and codebook may not be necessary if they are available for public use data. In all cases, if the author of the article points to an online location for such information, that is OK. IN THIS DOCUMENT, point out only a summary of shortcomings.

> INSTRUCTIONS: For all data sources, check for a data citation. Oftentimes authors will cite the **paper** in which a dataset is originally used, but this is not a *data* citation. If you have found what you think to be a data citation, quote it in the report as shown below for the "Example data". 

#### Template

> INSTRUCTIONS: Use this template for each of the actual data sources. Check off the boxes that are TRUE, leave empty those that are not.

- [ ] Dataset is  provided.
- [ ] Access conditions are described:
  - INSTRUCTIONS: summarize the access conditions here.
- [ ] DOI or URL is provided, and works: (PROVIDE URL OR DOI HERE)
- [ ] Data are not cited, but a working paper, article, or other document is cited (not a data citation)
- [ ] Data are cited [ ] in the manuscript, [ ] in the README

> INSTRUCTIONS: copy the citation here, whether data or the document citation.

> INSTRUCTIONS: Here is an example (delete it once you've read through it!)
>

> INSTRUCTIONS: ==>  Workflow stage: You have now completed *PartA*. Please update Jira and prepare to discuss with lead RA or supervisor!

> INSTRUCTIONS: ==>  Workflow stage: You are starting *PartB*.

## Stated Requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: The authors may have specified specific requirements in terms of software, computer hardware, etc. Please list them here. This is **different** from the Computing Environment of the Replicator. You have the option to amend these with unstated requirements later. If all requirements are listed, check the box "Requirements are complete".

- [ ] No requirements specified
- [ ] Software Requirements specified as follows:
  - Software 1
  - Software 2
- [ ] Computational Requirements specified as follows:
  - Cluster size, etc.
- [ ] Time Requirements specified as follows:
  - Length of necessary computation (hours, weeks, etc.)

- [ ] Requirements are complete.

> INSTRUCTIONS: If the requirements are NOT complete, please leave this line in. If unsure, leave this line in:

For missing requirements, see the list of required changes in the **FINDINGS** section.

> INSTRUCTIONS: If easier, simply copy-and-paste the authors' stated requirements here:

---

## Code description

> INSTRUCTIONS: Review the code (but do not run it yet). Identify programs that create "analysis files" ("data preparation code"). Identify programs that create tables and figures. Not every deposit will have separate programs for this.

> INSTRUCTIONS: Identify all **Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers**. Create a list, mapping each of them to a particular program and line number within the program (use [this template](code-check.xlsx)). Commit that list. You will come back to the list in your findings. IN THIS SECTION, point out only a summary description, including of shortcomings. E.g.

> INSTRUCTIONS: For example, you could write "There are four provided Stata do files, three Matlab .m files, including a "master.do"."
> INSTRUCTIONS: And you could list the issues you encounter:
> INSTRUCTIONS: - Table 5: could not identify code that produces Table 5
> INSTRUCTIONS: - Neither the program codes, nor the README, identify which tables are produced by what program.

{{ programs-summary.txt }}

```
{{ programs-list.txt }}
```

- [ ] The replication package contains a "main" or "master" file(s) which calls all other auxiliary programs.

> INSTRUCTIONS: If the above checkbox for "main" file is NOT checked, leave the following SUGGESTION in the report!

> [SUGGESTED] We strongly advise the use of a single (or a small number of) main control file(s) to automatically reproduce all figures and tables in the paper, without manual interaction.

> NOTE: In-text numbers that reference numbers in tables do not need to be listed. Only in-text numbers that correspond to no table or figure need to be listed.

## All data files provided

> INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify that the following list is complete, if pre-filled.
> INSTRUCTIONS: You can generate a similar list manually, or add manually to this list.
> INSTRUCTIONS: For large deposits, this can be done using the "Git Bash" program:
> INSTRUCTIONS: > find . -name \*.dta
> INSTRUCTIONS:  will list all Stata datasets. Replace `dta` with `.Rdata` or any other extension to find other datafiles.

```
{{ data-list.txt }}
```

## Computing Environment of the Replicator


> INSTRUCTIONS: This might be automated, for now, please fill in manually. Remove examples that are not relevant, adjust examples to fit special circumstances. Some of this is available from the standard log output in Stata or R. Some frequently used details are below. Some of these details can be found as follows:
>
> - (Windows) by right-clicking on "This PC"
> - (Mac) Apple-menu > "About this Mac"
> - (Linux) see code in `tools/linux-system-info.sh`
>
> Some options are listed below. Choose the one that applies.

- Stata/MP 18.0
- Matlab R2022a
- Intel Compiler 3.14152 (note: there is no such thing, so please verify the version!)

## Replication steps

> INSTRUCTIONS: provide details about your process of accessing the code and data.
> 
> - Do NOT detail things like "I save them on my Desktop".
> - DO describe actions that you did  as per instructions ("I added a config.do")
> - DO describe any other actions you needed to do ("I had to make changes in multiple programs"), without going into TOO much detail. (Link to the log file in the JIRA comments of this case!)
> 
> BUT:
> 
> - DO provide ENOUGH detail so that an author, without access to the logs, can understand what needed to be fixed, including a copy-paste of the error message.
> - DO commit to git before EACH new run with corrected code.
> - DO (after all debugging is completed) a full run through the data, top-to-bottom, once all bugs are fixed, using the approriate method (command line or right-click).

Example:

- Downloaded code and data from openICPSR provided.
- Added the config.do generating system information.
- Ran code as per README, but the third step did not work. (describe the problem HERE, but link to the logfile in the JIRA comments) (commit)
- Had to add undocumented package `distinct` to the install portion of the config file.  Ran again.
- Code failed because of a typo in the name of the file "`superdata.dta`" (was: `superdta.dta`). Fixed. Ran again.
- Code ran fine. 

> INSTRUCTIONS: ==>  Workflow stage: You are now going  to *Writing Report*. Verify that both PartA and PartB have been completed.

## Findings

> INSTRUCTIONS: Describe your findings both positive and negative in some detail, for each **Data Preparation Code, Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers**. You can re-use the Excel file created under *Code Description*. When errors happen, be as precise as possible. For differences in figures, provide both a screenshot of what the manuscript contains, as well as the figure produced by the code you ran. For differences in numbers, provide both the number as reported in the manuscript, as well as the number replicated. If too many numbers, contact your supervisor.


### Missing Requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: If the replication package contains Stata programs run `tools/Stata_scan_code/scan_packages.do`, ensuring that you update the global `codedir` first. If the data is accessible, add any packages not mentioned in the README to the `config.do` and paste the excel output as a table below. If the data is restricted-access and not obtainable in a reasonable amount of time, paste the excel output as a table below.

> INSTRUCTIONS: If it turns out that some requirements were not stated/ are incomplete (software, packages, operating system), please list the *missing* list of requirements here. Remove lines that are not necessary. If the stated requirements are complete, delete this entire section, including the [REQUIRED] tag at the end.

    - [ ] Version
    - Packages go here
  - [ ] Matlab
    - [ ] Version

  - Length of necessary computation (hours, weeks, etc.)

> [REQUIRED] Please amend README to contain complete requirements. 

You can copy the section above, amended if necessary.



### Data Preparation Code

Examples:

- Program `1-create-data.do` ran without error, output expected data
- Program `2-create-appendix-data.do` failed to produce any output.

### Tables

Examples:

- Table 1: Looks the same
- Table 2: (contains no data)
- Table 3: Minor differences in row 5, column 3, 0.003 instead of 0.3

### Figures

> INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a comparison with the paper when describing that figures look different. Use a screenshot for the paper, and the graph generated by the programs for the comparison. Reference the graph generated by the programs as a local file within the repository.

Example:

- Figure 1: Looks the same
- Figure 2: no program provided
- Figure 3: Paper version looks different from the one generated by programs:

Paper version:
![Paper version](template/dog.jpg)

Figure 3 generated by programs:

![Replicated version](template/odie.jpg)

### In-Text Numbers

> INSTRUCTIONS: list page and line number of in-text numbers. If ambiguous, cite the surrounding text, i.e., "the rate fell to 52% of all jobs: verified".

[ ] In-text numbers not verified.

[ ] There are no in-text numbers, or all in-text numbers stem from tables and figures.

[ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code

- Page 21, line 5: Same


## Classification

> INSTRUCTIONS: Make an assessment here.
>
> Full reproduction can include a small number of apparently insignificant changes in the numbers in the table. Full reproduction also applies when changes to the programs needed to be made, but were successfully implemented.
>
> Partial reproduction means that a significant number (>25%) of programs and/or numbers are different.
>
> Note that if some data is confidential and not available, then a partial reproduction applies. This should be noted in the Reasons.
>
> Note that when all data is confidential, it is unlikely that this exercise should have been attempted.
>
> Failure to reproduce: only a small number of programs ran successfully, or only a small number of numbers were successfully generated (<25%). This also applies when all data is restricted-access and none of the **main** tables/figures are run.

- [ ] full reproduction
- [ ] full reproduction with minor issues
- [ ] partial reproduction (see above)
- [ ] not able to reproduce most or all of the results (reasons see above)

### Reason for incomplete reproducibility

> INSTRUCTIONS: mark the reasons here why full reproduciblity was not achieved, and enter this information in JIRA. When results are fully reproduced, leave this section here, and mark "None".

- [ ] None.
- [ ] `Discrepancy in output` (either figures or numbers in tables or text differ)
- [ ] `Bugs in code`  that  were fixable by the replicator (but should be fixed in the final deposit)
- [ ] `Code missing`, in particular if it  prevented the replicator from completing the reproducibility check
  - [ ] `Data preparation code missing` should be checked if the code missing seems to be data preparation code
- [ ] `Code not functional` is more severe than a simple bug: it  prevented the replicator from completing the reproducibility check
- [ ] `Software not available to replicator`  may happen for a variety of reasons, but in particular (a) when the software is commercial, and the replicator does not have access to a licensed copy, or (b) the software is open-source, but a specific version required to conduct the reproducibility check is not available.
- [ ] `Insufficient time available to replicator` is applicable when (a) running the code would take weeks or more (b) running the code might take less time if sufficient compute resources were to be brought to bear, but no such resources can be accessed in a timely fashion (c) the replication package is very complex, and following all (manual and scripted) steps would take too long.
- [ ] `Data missing` is marked when data *should* be available, but was erroneously not provided, or is not accessible via the procedures described in the replication package
- [ ] `Data not available` is marked when data requires additional access steps, for instance purchase or application procedure. 
- [ ] `Missing README` is marked if there is no README to guide the replicator, or the README is not in compliance with AEA requirements
